Street-Names oftheCityofLondon. ByEilert Ekwall. (Oxford:
TheClarendon Press, 1954, pp.xvi+209,map. $2.40 atOxford
University Press, New York, N.Y.)
This scholarly work bytheauthor ofTheConcise Oxford Dic-
tionary ofEnglish Place-Names isdivided intotwoparts. Firstthere
isanintroductory essay ofsixty-seven pages explaining theprob-
lems involved intracing theorigin andthemodification ofthe
names applied tothestreets ofOldLondon, those established be-
fore1500. This isfollowed byadictionary ofthese nam~s inwhich
Professor Ekwall amply documents hisconclusions concerning their
history andmorphology. IntheIntroduction, Professor Ekwall also
provides anextensive bibliography andtraces thecontribution
made byprevious works inthisfield, praising HenryA. Harben's
Dictionary ofLondon (1918) as"themost important contribution
tothetopography andhistory ofLondon." ButHarben's book is
out-of-print; andProfessor Ekwall's littlevolume isfurther justified
bythefactthathehasdiscovered material thatenables himtosup-
plement andtocorrect anumber ofHarben's conclusions.
Oneofthegreat values ofthepresent work isProfessor Ekwall's
discussion oftheprinciples ofname-giving, well-illustrated inthe
organization ofhisdictionary andinthematerials which hein-
cludes inthehistory ofvarious street-names. First, heclassifies the
names: those in-street, in-lane, in-row, in-alley, in-hill,andthose
without such adesignation. Then hesubdivides, grouping com-
pound names according totheir firstelement: those insingular or
plural form, those withorwithout agenitive -s,andthose withthe
element derived from external characteristics, from some article or
commodity produced oroffered forsale,asinMilk Street) from'

from anobject oraplace name, asinSpittle Lane) probably from a
hospital inthelane, from innsortaverns, from churches, orfrom
some activity carried onnearby.
Inthedictionary sections some fourhundred terms, located by
ward, aretraced through public documents, such ascharters, ab-
stracts, andcourt rolls, church registers, letters andmanuscripts of
monarchs, royalty andcommoners, diaries, memorials, andother
such contemporary sources, aswellasthebooks ofProfessor Ek-
wall's forerunners inthisfield ofstudy. Such anabundance of
material forresearch, much ofitinexistence before Columbus
discovered America, makes forinteresting documentation asto
names used, butleaves stillundecided theorigins ofmany. Forex-
ample, thename Threadneedle Street wasbysome commentators
derived "from asign-board with three needles onitorfrom the
armsoftheneedlemakers' company, which arestated tohaveborne
three needles (Harben). Butitisunlikely thatthename should not
beconnected with thatofthechildren's game thread needle ...
Thebroad Threadneedle Street mayhavebeen found particularly
suitable forthegame." Itisevident thatinmany cases theorigins
cannever beaccurately determined.
Changes intheform ofthename can,however, betraced: for
example,' Lombard Street) from Longebrod (1252), Langburnes-
trade(1285), Langebournestrete(1312), Lombardstrete(from 1318).
Professor Ekwall comments: "The original Langebordstrete meant
'thestreet leading toLangebord.' ...Thename contains thewords
longandboard (OEbord) ....Apossible meaning would be'the
longtable(s),' referring tosome stall(s) toplace wares on."Finch
Lane wasonceFinkeslane (1231-45), "thealternative Finch being
atfirstaNorman spelling withchfork."AndFetter Lane wasorig-
inally called Faytuneslane (1292), probably derived from theME
faitor) meaning 'vagrant' or'cheat.' Such glimpses oflifeinOld
London areabundant inProfessor Ekwall's study ofthehistory of
early street names. L .JDEVETTE •AVIDSON
Theory ofNames. ByErnst Pulg'ram. (Pp.49.American Name So-
ciety, Berkeley, California, 1954. Firstpublished inBeitriige zur
Namenforschung) Vol.V,no.2.)
Ernst Pulgram concludes hismonograph onthetheory ofnames
byproposing adefinition:

Book Reviews 53
Itherefore submit thefollowing definition (interms offunction, notofform)
forproper name: Aproper name isanoun used KaT E'(J'X~V, inanon-universal
function, with orwithout recognizable current lexical value, ofwhich thepo-
tential meaning coincides with andnever exceeds itsactual meaning, andwhich
isattached asalabel tooneanimate being oroneinanimate object (ortomore
than oneinthecaseofcollective names) forthepurpose ofspecific distinction
from among anumber oflikeorinsome respects similar beings orobjects that
areeither innomanner distinguished from oneanother or,forourinterest,
notsufficiently distinguished.
Since thepurpose oftheentire monograph istodefine theterm
"proper name," adescription ofsome ofthemethods usedtoarrive
atthissomewhat complicated definition isinorder.
After establishing, bymeans ofexamples, that"thegiving and
bearing ofnames" areuniversally accepted andindicate a"com-
monneed" among human beings, Pulgram argues, onphilosophic
grounds, that"theactofnaming must have been among themost
ancient speech performances," andthatsince aname canfulfill the
taskof"linguistic communication" asdescribed byBloomfield, "a
grammatical distinction between noun andname isnotlegitimate."
After aconsiderable examination ofthevarious categories of
meanings intowhich proper names fallinvarious languages, he
concludes that"notonlyname-bearing, butalsonamebuilding isa
universal human practice, with thesame elementary rules every-
where." Furthermore, hehasfound that"allproper names, regard-
lessoftheirhistorical form, aretobederived fromcommon nouns,"
although thedictionary value mayhave been obscured bytime. It
follows, therefore, that"noun" and"name" areoneandthat"the
disparity thatiscommonly felttoexist between them isoneprob-
duced byusage orperformance."
Pulgram thenturns hisattention topinpointing thedistinction
between proper name andcommon noun. Herejects asunfruitful
theetymological study oftheword "name" orovo~a forabasic
meaning, because theIndo-European roothasnotbeendetermined,
andattacks theproblem philosophically. HecitesJ.S.Milltothe
effect thatacommon noun maybe"truly affirmed, inthesame
sense, ofanindefinite number ofthings," while aproper name "is
only capable ofbeing truly affirmed, inthesame sense, ofone
thing." With thistheauthor agrees, buthetakes issue with Mill
when thelatter willallow noconnotative value toaproper name.

Pulgram shows thataproper name newtothehearer isnomore
devoid ofmeaning thanacommon noun newtoahearer, andthat
names have varying degrees ofconnotative value dependent upon
their familiarity totheuser. Itiswhen theconnotative value ofa
name grows verygreat, andthedenotative value isforgotten, that
aname becomes acommon noun. Thechange ofname tonoun Pul-
gram calls "anincrease ofextensive andadecrease ofintensive
meaning," andonehasonlytoreverse theformula forthechange
from noun toname. Inalanguage ofwhich every speaker hadper-
fectknowledge, everything would have aspecific name; "every
noun would beoneparexcellence." Since wedonotpossess perfect
knowledge andmust lump similar things intocategories, wehave
developed "general terms" and"universals," that is,common
nouns.
Common nouns, bytheir verynature, contain more meaning
than oneusually desires toexpress inaparticular context, anda
modifier isrequired tonarrow andconfine theword toitsdesired
function. Aproper name, however, canhavenomore meaning than
itpossesses initself andcanrequire nomodifier tolimit itsmean-
ing.When itbegins tomean more thanaparticular person orthing,
itisonthewaytobecoming anoun.
Pulgram, before summing upinthedefinition which begins this
review, defends hisphilosophical definition bymaintaining that
theproblems ofnaming areextra-linguistic, andthat, although
linguistic andgrammatical methods areappropriate forseparate
languages, theproblem ofn"ames isoneof"phonemes, morphemes,"
andthelikewhich "appear inevery language," and"should bere-
garded asgeneral characteristics ofhuman speech andofmankind."

Marlborough Place Names. ByH.A.H.Insull. (Wellington: A.H.

Theshortcomings ofthisbook arerevealed inthepreface: itis

ablyinNewZealand, theauthor writes: "Ishallbehappy tolearn
ofanyorigins, history ormeanings ofanyofthese names whose as-

sociations Ihave notyetbeen abletotrack down." Andhisun-
familiarity withMaori hasledhimtorepeat what others have said
ofnames derived from thatlanguage ortoomitthem altogether. It
isreasonable tosuggest, then, thatmore timeshould have elapsed
benveen thefirstprinting ofthismaterial anditspublication in
book form, forthencorrespondents might have added toMr.In-
sull's store ofinformation, theauthor himself would have hadan
opportunity torework hisstudy, andperhaps astudent ofMaori
could havebeen enlisted asacollaborator.
Four so-called chapters, eachabout three pages inlength, precede
thealphabetical listofnames: "Maori Names," where thedifficul-
tiesofthestudent ofNewZealand place-names areapparent from
thecitation ofthename Pare-ora) thefirstelement ofwhich bears
tendifferent meanings while thesecond maybetranslated ineight
different ,vays; "Discovery oftheSounds," which deals with the
period from Captain Cook's firstvisitin1770to1854; "The Early
Whalers," whocommenced their activities in1827; and"The First
Settlers," whodate from 1847-50. Each ofthese chapters needs
more extended treatment, forMr.Insull assumes abackground of
reference thathisreaders inother parts oftheworld donotpossess
andcanacquire onlywithgreat difficulty.
Thelistofnames isinteresting, notonlytotheonomatologist but
tothestudent ofhistory andlegend aswell.While itistruethatthe
introductory pages touch briefly onplace-names given bytheMaori,
theearly explorers, thefirstwhalers, andtheearly settlers ofthe
Province ofMarlborough, thebook would gainconsiderably from a
summarizing chapter thatattempted aclassification ofthematerial

Dane County) Wisconsin) andR.L.Ramsay (Our Storehouse of
Missouri Place-Names) orthesuggestions ofG.R.Stewart (Names)

mote English-speaking land isgood tohave. Oneisgrateful, too,

aspects ofAmerican life.
Although allthesubjects covered inProfessor Stewart's book are

brief survey ofChristian names, middle names andfamily names in
America from colonial daysdown tothepresent time. Theauthor

theformer, hefinds, aredistinctive while those ofthelatter are
much likethose oftheWhites.
