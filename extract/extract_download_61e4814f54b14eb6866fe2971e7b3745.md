Introduction  
 
 
The corpus listed details forty place -names from the county of Essex (see Appendix). 
As is the case for much of England, the dominant nomenclature is Old English but the corpus 
also exhibits other languages such as British, Latin, Old Norse, Old French, an d Middle 
English. We can extract details about the history and languages of this area of Britain through 
examining place -names, which fossilise these details, first looking at the other languages of 
the corpus and then finishing with the dominant Old Engli sh names.  
 
 
 1. Languages  
 
Pre-Anglo -Saxon  
 
 
The Germanic migration to the British Isles results in British, a Celtic language,  
having limited influence on the place -names of North Essex. Evidence for a continued pre -
English presence after the migration through place -names is sparse in comparison with the 
West of the country, being in Jackson’s Area 1 with a low number of Celtic -derived names.1 
Nonetheless there is British influence in the corpus, including the river names Stour and Colne. 
Colne, an ancie nt pre -English river name of uncertain meaning,2 features as an element in the 
Colne village names in the corpus, Wakes Colne, Earls Colne, Colne Engaine, and White 
Colne. These names are likely to have survived because they were known to a great many 
numb er of people and this gives the name a greater survival chance.3 Indeed, topographical 
features that are prominent in the landscape means that the name for it in the native language 
would be continually used even if the language is replaced; but for that t o happen there either 
needs to be frequent trade between the two peoples, or co -habiting an area.4 Walton -on-the-
Naze challenges the assumption that the Britons did not live with the Germanic tribes in the 
East. Walton -on-the-Naze means ‘farmstead or villa ge of the Britons’, from OE walh, ‘Briton’. 
Names featuring OE walh suggest that the settlement is recognisably British5 and Gelling 
suggests that these names are evidence for cohabitation for a time between the Germanic 
tribes and the Britons.6

INNERVATE  Leading student work in English studies, Volume 10 (2017 -2018), pp. 79-90 Dovercourt’s element dŵr ‘the waters’ describes its position on the coast and at the 
mouth of the Stour estuary; British elements typically describe topographical features.7 
Instances of Latin being borrowed into Old English nomenclature are rare:8 though Latin was 
the administrative language of the Romans in Britain, it is possible that the Latin spoken by 
the Romano -Britis h appears in Dovercourt. Dovercourt features the specific element  cort, 
from Latin cohors meaning ‘piece cut off’, which describes Dovercourt’s geographical 
position.9 Gelling notes that  corte is a single instance borrowing and is thus likely directly 
borrowed from Latin speakers.10 Therefore, Dovercourt could be a continuum of the name 
used before the Germanic migration due to the use of both British and Latin.  
 
Another unclear name is Colchester. Colchester’s earliest recording is Camulodonum, 
Reaney su ggests is Celtic for ‘the fort of Camulos’.11 Later names featuring the element 
‘colonia’ include veteranorum colonia , indicating a Roman veteran’s colony. Though the first 
element of Colchester could be a syncopated form of ‘colonia’, it is unlikely that t he early 
names contribute to the Colneceastre in the 10th century and beyond. Whilst the caster 
element is a borrowing from Latin into Old English, the element ‘colne’ is most likely related to 
the River Colne nearby, like the Colne villages. The naming pr ocess appears to undergo 
metathesis, a transposition of letters within a word, with the entry Colneceastre going to 
Colenceaster and remaining so for several attestations possibly before the unstressed syllable 
(underlined) in Colenceaster disappears, leav ing Colcestre (12th century) and other 
variations.  
Layer Breton, Layder de la Haye, and Layer Marney, all have the same element with 
manorial affixes attached; however, ‘layer’ is contested, like Colchester. Whilst it is possible 
that it comes from ON leirr, ‘clay’12, the settlements are on superficial deposits of sand and 
gravel. Instead, a lost Celtic stream name Leire has been suggested.13 
 
Old Norse  
 
  
There had been Viking settlement in the British Isles from around 870AD, and in 
886AD, the Treaty of Guthrum and Alfred was formalised, creating an area of Britain now 
under administrative control of the Danes,14 “up on the Thames, and then up on the Lea, a nd 
along the Lea unto its source, then straight to Bedford, then up on the Ouse unto Watling 
Street”.15 This means that the corpus area was part of the Danelaw.  
The names of the corpus suggest Norse contact in Essex. Thorpe -le-Soken and Kirby -
le-Soke both feature common ON elements. Gelling notes that the name Kirby, ‘a village with 
a church’, are usually settlements that are appellative, describing their dominant feature, which 
in this case would have been a church. ON þorp, meaning ‘secondary settlement’,  is difficult

INNERVATE  Leading student work in English studies, Volume 10 (2017 -2018), pp. 79-90 to distinguish from it’s cognate, OE throp16; however, the closeness to the other ON name in 
the corpus means that it is probable that Thorpe -le-Soken is Norse in origin.  
Supporting this is an OE name, Harwich (OE here-wīc, ‘army camp’); though there is 
no Norse element, indicating that the Vikings did not name the settlement themselves, 
historical context could suggest that this area was a Viking army base due to the area being 
close to warring Wessex, supporting the notion of Sca ndinavian influence in the area, but little 
widespread settlement.  
 
Norman French and French  
 
 
Though the Norman French dialect had a profound impact on the English language as 
a whole,17 this affect was not seen widespread across place -names due to being the language 
of the elite18 resulting in little bilingualism and few complete Old English name replacements, 
but resulting in a change in phonology.19  
There is only one instance of all elements in a place -name being of French origin in 
the corpus, and that is Beaumont -cum-Moze, being OFr bel + mont , ‘beautiful hill’. The site’s 
first recorded name was Fulepet in the 1086 Doomsday Book, meaning ‘foul pit’. Thus the site 
undergoes a re -naming in French after the Conquest; many of the names of Norman origin in 
England are “deliberate creations of the builders… not spontaneous descriptions of the site 
that arose in natural speech”20 and reflect aspiration aspects of French naming practise in 
England.  
Gelling notes that the Normans made “violent changes… to render English names 
pronounceable”.21 Phonetic change over time can be seen in the earliest recordings of place -
names. Elmstead Market’s earliest recordings suggest influence from a Norman scribe: both 
Elmesteda and Almestedā are early recording in 1086 from the Norman scribe written 
Doomsday Book, and Aunestede in 1248, with alm- and aun- being due to such influence.

Woodland  
 
Gelling explains that there is “relationship between what is plentiful in the landscape 
and the objects selected as defining features”.22 There are diverse woodland names, 
suggesting that these were prominent features of the landscape when being named.  
The wood -related names are clustered together (fig. ‘woodland related names’). Examples 
include Mis tley (mistletoe), Oakley (oak), Weeley (?willow), Little and Great Bromley (broom), 
Little and Great Bentley (bent grass), Elmstead Market (elm), and Boxsted (beech). Ardleigh, 
Bromley, Bentley, Mistley, Oakley contain lēah, ‘woodland, woodland clearing’, but two, 
Boxsted and Elmstead Market, have OE stede ‘place’.  
Three names stand out with the elements OE feld and OE leah, Bradfield, OE brād ‘broad’ + 
feld ‘open land’, and Ardleigh and Bromley, suggesting patches of less dense woodland.

INNERVATE  Leading student work in English studies, Volume 10 (2017 -2018), pp. 79-90  These tree-related names suggest that the area was once heavily wooded; the maps 
can show us that the patches of woodland are close together (fig. ‘remains of heavily wooded  
area’) supporting the idea.

  83 
INNERVATE  Leading student work in English studies, Volume 10 (2017 -2018), pp. 79-90 Water  
 
 
The area of the corpus has two major rivers, the  Colne and the Stour, as well as an 
eastern coast with the Stour estuary, which is the tidal mouth of the river Stour. There are 
names in the corpus that reflect the water’s dominance of the area.  
Several names such as Dovercourt , Earls Colne, Wakes Colne, and Colne Engayne, feature 
the river names Colne and Dŵr, demonstrating their proximity to the river. Wrabness and 
Walton -on-the-Naze feature the element OE ness , ‘headland’, where it is used for low -lying 
land jutting into wate r or marsh, common in Essex.23 
 Marsh or wetland is also indicated through the names. Element OE ēg, ‘island’, 
features in two names and the names suggest that ēg is not ‘island’ in the modern sense. 
Though Brightlingsea is surrounded by water, the OE ēg in Ramsey describes a drier area 
surrounded by wet ground as mentioned by Gelling,24 not an island surrounded by water. A 
marsh is indicated in the name Lamarsh (OE loam + marsh).  
 
Furthermore, wet ground is indicated through the name Weeley. Reaney in his EPNS volume 
suggests that Weeley has the element OE wīh or wēoh, ‘idol’.25 However, Weeley 
(fig.’Weeley’) is situated on a superficial deposit mixture of silt, clay  and sand, silt being a 
material carried by running water. Willows enjoy wet ground, and thus willow would be a 
feasible name.

84 
INNERVATE  Leading student work in English studies, Volume 10 (2017 -2018), pp. 79-90 Hills  
 
Though it is clear through British nomenclature that the Anglo -Saxons had an extensive 
vocabulary around hills and valle ys, the corpus does not exhibit a wide range.  
Wivenhoe, featuring OE hōh, describes a particular type of hill shape that has a slow incline 
peaking then drops concave . Hōh is one of the names that, according to Gelling, are used 
persistently for a specifi c shape of hill; however, in East Anglia, hōh is used to describe any 
spur of land, which explains Wivenhoe’s lack of conformity.26 Another possible hill name is 
Coggeshall. Coggeshall, possibly ‘nook of a man called Cocc or Cogg’, alternatively the first 
element may be OE cocc ‘cock, woodcock’,  cocc ‘heap, hillock’, or  cogg ‘cog wheel’. All of 
these possibilities except the perso nal name could suggest a description of the landscape 
surrounding the settlement, though it is notable that Coggeshall is not situated on a sharp 
incline.  
 
The Norman French influence on the hill names for Essex can be seen in the names 
Mount Bures and Be aumont -cum-Moze, both featuring ‘mount’, with Mount Bures being from 
Middle English borrowed from French, ME munt, ‘at the mount or hill’, and Beaumont -cum-
Moze from OFr mont , demonstrating the Norman influence on topographical naming.  
 
 
Vegetation and far ming  
 
 
The system of the hundreds, first recorded by Edmund I, was an area of land that can 
have 100 households reliant on it, whilst also having farming, administrative and punishment 
responsibilities.27 This appears to be the case for the nomenclature of  the chosen area; the 
number of tūn names suggests that farming was one of the dominant industries. For example, 
names featuring the element tūn, ‘farmstead’, are Alphamstone, Frinton -on-Sea, Clacton -on-
Sea, and Walton -on-the-Naze, with Alphamstone, Clacto n-on-Sea, and Walton -on-the-Naze 
all featuring a personal name element, suggesting that particular people owned such farms. 
Nonetheless, Frinton -on-Sea’s early attestation Frientuna causes some ambiguity: either 
‘farmstead of a man called  Fritha ’ or ‘prot ected farmstead’ from OE frithen , ‘protect’.  
Another indication that farming was prevalent in the area is the use of more specific 
elements such as OE hramsa in Ramey, ‘island where wild garlic grows’, and OE ersc 
‘ploughed field’ in Pebmarsh, ‘ploughed field of a man called Pybba’. There are also more 
generic elements such as OE  tiege ‘enclosure’ in Marks Tey, and wīc, ‘specialised farm’, used 
to form the simplex name Wix.  
 
 
Habitative, group, and personal names  
 
 
It can be noted in the corpus that from the abundance of names featuring personal 
names, personal names have played a sizeable part Britain’s nomenclature. All of the names 
in this corpus are Old English, and the names that we can tell feature personal nam es almost

  85 
INNERVATE  Leading student work in English studies, Volume 10 (2017 -2018), pp. 79-90 certainly are Alphamstone, Braintree, Brightlingsea, Clacton -on-Sea, Dedham, Lamarsh, 
Lawford, Pebmarsh, Wivenhoe, and Wrabness. Further possible names with personal name 
elements include Alresford, Coggeshall, Frinton -on-Sea, and Manningtree. So me of these 
names are duethematic names (two themes in the name), such as Ælfhelm (Alphamstone) 
and Beorhtric (Brightlingsea), whilst others are monothematic, like Clacc (Clacton), or 
monothematic with added final vowel such as the possible Fritha (Frinto n-on-Sea). These 
place -names also demonstrate the fossilised Old English genitive case (weak gen. –n), such 
as Wivenhoe and the early attestations of Pebmarsh, Benenhers . Wievnhoe features ‘Wīfe’, 
either a woman’s personal name or indicating notable female  settlers; furthermore, St Osyth 
was named after the priory dedicated to a sainted princess Osgyth in the 7th century.  
Two names, Langham and Walton -on-the-Naze, are group names, being ‘homestead 
of the family or followers of a man called Lahha’, OE pers.  name + -inga- + hām, and 
‘farmstead or village of the Britons’, from OE walh (genitive plural wala) + tūn.  
 
There are several instances of additional suffixes in the corpus that denote ownership 
of land or of a settlement. These are not necessarily Engli sh in origin, instead denoting the 
Anglo -Norman families that dominated land ownership after the Norman Conquest; examples 
include Marks Tey, Layer Breton, Layer de la Hay, Layer Marney, Colne Engayne, and Wakes 
Colne. Most of these are familial affixes, b ut the ‘earls’ in Earls Colne related to the rank of the 
owners, the Earls of Oxford, and one hide of land in White Colne was held by Dimidius 
Blancus, Dimidus Blancus being contracted to ‘miblanc’ in Colne Miblanc in 1225 and then 
translated into English as ‘white’, appearing in the name by 1272.28  
 
Administration, infrastructure, and boundary markers  
 
The corpus demonstrates evidence of administration throughout the area. The OE 
cæster indicates a Roman settlement, and they are likely to have remaining structures. 
Colchester’s extensive Roman buildings and remains would have been a suitable 
administrati on site and archaeology confirms that the Germanic tribes did indeed settle early 
in the town and in the surrounding areas, with graves between the 5th and 7th centuries.29 
Further structures referred to includes Layer Breton: an early name, stokkeneleire , comes 
from OE stoccen , ‘made of logs’, and indicates a wooden structure in the area. River crossings 
are suggested through the names Alresford, Lawford and Fordham, containing the OE ford, 
‘ford or river crossing’.  
Administration and area organisation can also be found in the corpus. Colchester’s 
previous attestation, c olonia veteranorum suggest that there was a Roman military colony in 
the town. Later administration and land ownership is shown through the affixes of the names 
Thorpe -le-Soken and Kirby -le-Soken. These names contain ‘soken’ from OE sōcn , ‘area of 
particular jurisdiction’, owned by the Chapter of St Paul’s in London30 and this additional 
element appears to be a recorded marker for the places since the 14th century.  
 
Possible boundary markers or meeting places are shown through Braintree (tree of a 
man called  Branca ) and uncertain Manningtree (tree of a man called Manna ). Manningtree is 
positioned at a narrowing in the River Stour, so would be a practical meeting place, whilst 
Braintre e is positioned along the Roman road Stane Street.

INNERVATE  Leading student work in English studies, Volume 10 (2017 -2018), pp. 79-90 2. Conclusion  
 
 
The study of the place -names of North -East Essex can be hugely informative and a 
useful approach in the historical study of England. Place -names fossilise vocabulary of the 
every day speech of the people living in the British Isles that would otherwise not  survive due 
to not being recorded in written documents, especially personal names found in the fore 
mentioned corpus such as  Ægil and  Branca . It also allows us to learn about how the Anglo -
Saxons and others thought about their landscape like the extensi ve and precise -meaning 
water -names in this corpus. The corpus also demonstrates the extent of language contact in 
an area, and contributes to the discussion around cohabitation of Britons and the Germanic 
migrants. Therefore, it is clear that the study of place -names is an exceptionally valuable 
discipline in learning about the history and language of Britain.
