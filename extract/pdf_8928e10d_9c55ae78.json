(Oxford:\nTheClarendon Press, 1954, pp.xvi+209,map. $2.40 atOxford\nUniversity Press, New York, N.Y.)\nThis scholarly work bytheauthor ofTheConcise Oxford Dic-\ntionary ofEnglish Place-Names isdivided intotwoparts. Firstthere\nisanintroductory essay ofsixty-seven pages explaining theprob-\nlems involved intracing theorigin andthemodification ofthe\nnames applied tothestreets ofOldLondon, those established be-\nfore1500. This isfollowed byadictionary ofthese nam~s inwhich\nProfessor Ekwall amply documents hisconclusions concerning their\nhistory andmorphology. IntheIntroduction, Professor Ekwall also\nprovides anextensive bibliography andtraces thecontribution\nmade byprevious works inthisfield, praising HenryA. Harben's\nDictionary ofLondon (1918) as\"themost important contribution\ntothetopography andhistory ofLondon.\" ButHarben's book is\nout-of-print; andProfessor Ekwall's littlevolume isfurther justified\nbythefactthathehasdiscovered material thatenables himtosup-\nplement andtocorrect anumber ofHarben's conclusions.\nOneofthegreat values ofthepresent work isProfessor Ekwall's\ndiscussion oftheprinciples ofname-giving, well-illustrated inthe\norganization ofhisdictionary andinthematerials which hein-\ncludes inthehistory ofvarious street-names. First, heclassifies the\nnames: those in-street, in-lane, in-row, in-alley, in-hill,andthose\nwithout such adesignation. Then hesubdivides, grouping com-\npound names according totheir firstelement: those insingular or\nplural form, those withorwithout agenitive -s,andthose withthe\nelement derived from external characteristics, from some article or\ncommodity produced oroffered forsale,asinMilk Street) from'\ntheir situation, asinThames Street) from Citygates, from various\nbuildings orstructures, from crosses, andfrom markets, asin\nCheapside) from asurname, from some other kind ofpersonal\ndescription, asinChancery Lane) originally Chancellor Lane) from\nthename ofananimal, asinHuggin Lane) Hoggeslane in1234-5,\n\n52 Book Reviews\nfrom anobject oraplace name, asinSpittle Lane) probably from a\nhospital inthelane, from innsortaverns, from churches, orfrom\nsome activity carried onnearby.\nInthedictionary sections some fourhundred terms, located by\nward, aretraced through public documents, such ascharters, ab-\nstracts, andcourt rolls, church registers, letters andmanuscripts of\nmonarchs, royalty andcommoners, diaries, memorials, andother\nsuch contemporary sources, aswellasthebooks ofProfessor Ek-\nwall's forerunners inthisfield ofstudy. Such anabundance of\nmaterial forresearch, much ofitinexistence before Columbus\ndiscovered America, makes forinteresting documentation asto\nnames used, butleaves stillundecided theorigins ofmany. Forex-\nample, thename Threadneedle Street wasbysome commentators\nderived \"from asign-board with three needles onitorfrom the\narmsoftheneedlemakers' company, which arestated tohaveborne\nthree needles (Harben). Butitisunlikely thatthename should not\nbeconnected with thatofthechildren's game thread needle ...\nThebroad Threadneedle Street mayhavebeen found particularly\nsuitable forthegame.\" Itisevident thatinmany cases theorigins\ncannever beaccurately determined.\nChanges intheform ofthename can,however, betraced: for\nexample,' Lombard Street) from Longebrod (1252), Langburnes-\ntrade(1285), Langebournestrete(1312), Lombardstrete(from 1318).\nProfessor Ekwall comments: \"The original Langebordstrete meant\n'thestreet leading toLangebord.' ...Thename contains thewords\nlongandboard (OEbord) ....Apossible meaning would be'the\nlongtable(s),' referring tosome stall(s) toplace wares on.\"Finch\nLane wasonceFinkeslane (1231-45), \"thealternative Finch being\natfirstaNorman spelling withchfork.\"AndFetter Lane wasorig-\ninally called Faytuneslane (1292), probably derived from theME\nfaitor) meaning 'vagrant' or'cheat.' Such glimpses oflifeinOld\nLondon areabundant inProfessor Ekwall's study ofthehistory of\nearly street names. L .JDEVETTE •AVIDSON\nTheory ofNames. ByErnst Pulg'ram. (Pp.49.American Name So-\nciety, Berkeley, California, 1954. Firstpublished inBeitriige zur\nNamenforschung) Vol.V,no.2.)\nErnst Pulgram concludes hismonograph onthetheory ofnames\nbyproposing adefinition:\n\nBook Reviews 53\nItherefore submit thefollowing definition (interms offunction, notofform)\nforproper name: Aproper name isanoun used KaT E'(J'X~V, inanon-universal\nfunction, with orwithout recognizable current lexical value, ofwhich thepo-\ntential meaning coincides with andnever exceeds itsactual meaning, andwhich\nisattached asalabel tooneanimate being oroneinanimate object (ortomore\nthan oneinthecaseofcollective names) forthepurpose ofspecific distinction\nfrom among anumber oflikeorinsome respects similar beings orobjects that\nareeither innomanner distinguished from oneanother or,forourinterest,\nnotsufficiently distinguished.\nSince thepurpose oftheentire monograph istodefine theterm\n\"proper name,\" adescription ofsome ofthemethods usedtoarrive\natthissomewhat complicated definition isinorder.\nAfter establishing, bymeans ofexamples, that\"thegiving and\nbearing ofnames\" areuniversally accepted andindicate a\"com-\nmonneed\" among human beings, Pulgram argues, onphilosophic\ngrounds, that\"theactofnaming must have been among themost\nancient speech performances,\" andthatsince aname canfulfill the\ntaskof\"linguistic communication\" asdescribed byBloomfield, \"a\ngrammatical distinction between noun andname isnotlegitimate.\"\nAfter aconsiderable examination ofthevarious categories of\nmeanings intowhich proper names fallinvarious languages, he\nconcludes that\"notonlyname-bearing, butalsonamebuilding isa\nuniversal human practice, with thesame elementary rules every-\nwhere.\" Furthermore, hehasfound that\"allproper names, regard-\nlessoftheirhistorical form, aretobederived fromcommon nouns,\"\nalthough thedictionary value mayhave been obscured bytime. It\nfollows, therefore, that\"noun\" and\"name\" areoneandthat\"the\ndisparity thatiscommonly felttoexist between them isoneprob-\nduced byusage orperformance.\"\nPulgram thenturns hisattention topinpointing thedistinction\nbetween proper name andcommon noun. Herejects asunfruitful\ntheetymological study oftheword \"name\" orovo~a forabasic\nmeaning, because theIndo-European roothasnotbeendetermined,\nandattacks theproblem philosophically. HecitesJ.S.Milltothe\neffect thatacommon noun maybe\"truly affirmed, inthesame\nsense, ofanindefinite number ofthings,\" while aproper name \"is\nonly capable ofbeing truly affirmed, inthesame sense, ofone\nthing.\" With thistheauthor agrees, buthetakes issue with Mill\nwhen thelatter willallow noconnotative value toaproper name.\n\nStanford University54 Book Reviews\nPulgram shows thataproper name newtothehearer isnomore\ndevoid ofmeaning thanacommon noun newtoahearer, andthat\nnames have varying degrees ofconnotative value dependent upon\ntheir familiarity totheuser. Itiswhen theconnotative value ofa\nname grows verygreat, andthedenotative value isforgotten, that\naname becomes acommon noun. Thechange ofname tonoun Pul-\ngram calls \"anincrease ofextensive andadecrease ofintensive\nmeaning,\" andonehasonlytoreverse theformula forthechange\nfrom noun toname. Inalanguage ofwhich every speaker hadper-\nfectknowledge, everything would have aspecific name; \"every\nnoun would beoneparexcellence.\" Since wedonotpossess perfect\nknowledge andmust lump similar things intocategories, wehave\ndeveloped \"general terms\" and\"universals,\" that is,common\nnouns.\nCommon nouns, bytheir verynature, contain more meaning\nthan oneusually desires toexpress inaparticular context, anda\nmodifier isrequired tonarrow andconfine theword toitsdesired\nfunction. Aproper name, however, canhavenomore meaning than\nitpossesses initself andcanrequire nomodifier tolimit itsmean-\ning.When itbegins tomean more thanaparticular person orthing,\nitisonthewaytobecoming anoun.\nPulgram, before summing upinthedefinition which begins this\nreview, defends hisphilosophical definition bymaintaining that\ntheproblems ofnaming areextra-linguistic, andthat, although\nlinguistic andgrammatical methods areappropriate forseparate\nlanguages, theproblem ofn\"ames isoneof\"phonemes, morphemes,\"\nandthelikewhich \"appear inevery language,\" and\"should bere-\ngarded asgeneral characteristics ofhuman speech andofmankind.\"\nLLOYD L.DEWITT\nMarlborough Place Names.
