The unique heritage of place- names in North West England 
Geoffrey Leech, Lancaster University, UK 
 
1. Introduction  
 
This is not an academic article. I am not a scholar of the history of English. Yet this article deals mainly with developments in the remote history of the English language. 
So why this article with this title?  When I was invited to contri bute to this volume in 
honour of Professor Keiko Ikegami, I wanted  to write something with a historical 
theme, as a fitting tribute. My solution wa s to write on a topic which has interested me 
for many years: the place-names of the part of English where I live, the North West of 
England.  My interest in place-names began earl y as a hobby, and I have been a member 
of the English Place-Name Society for many y ears. Curiously, the first academic ‘job’ 
I ever had was concerned with place-name s. In 1959 I had just finished my final 
examinations for the B.A. at London Universi ty, and was waiting to  learn the result. I 
undertook some humble unskilled work (all I can remember is writing oddly-spelt 
place-names on little slips of paper) for the head of my Department, Professor A.H. 
Smith, then probably the leadi ng toponymist in the country.  So it could be said that 
place-name studies began my academic career . But I have never undertaken serious 
research or produced publica tions in the field. This pape r does not contain original 
material, but relies on the work of schol ars most of whom have been well-known 
toponymists of English, whose work I briefly review below.  
2. Background: history, geography and scholarship 

 2
 For those who are not familiar with No rth-West England, I should explain that 
it is a region extending from the Mersey  – etymologically, the ‘boundary river’ on 
which Liverpool stands – along the wester n side of England northwards to the 
Scottish border. No part of it is more than 50 or 60 kilometres from the Irish Sea. Today it roughly consists of four areas: the conurbations of Merseyside (including 
Liverpool) and Greater Manche ster, and the two counties of Lancashire and Cumbria. 
In the south, the areas of Merseyside and Greater Manchester are highly industrialized 
and densely populated. In the north, the count y of Cumbria is spar sely populated, and 
contains what is commonly considered the mo st beautiful part of England – the Lake 
District, celebrated in English literatu re through the work of such writers as 
Wordsworth, Coleridge and Ruskin, not to me ntion the children’s stories of Beatrix 
Potter. [Fig 1: Map with traditional counties] 
[Fig 2: Map with present-day counties] 
 When the English Place-Name Society (EPNS) was founded in 1923, the map of North-West England was administratively different from today. Then, the big cities 
of Liverpool and Manchester were parts of Lancashire, the most populous county in 
England. Lancashire extended north into the Lake District, and shared the region of 
present-day Cumbria with the two now- abolished counties of Westmorland and 
Cumberland. The EPNS planned its survey of English place-names county by county, 
inevitably using the old county boundaries , which persisted up to 1974. The great 
Swedish toponymist Eilert Ekwall had alre ady undertaken a remarkable pioneering 
work in 1922 – The Place-Names of Lancashire  (Manchester: the University Press), 
and after more than 80 years th is is still the most author itative survey of that county. 
Incidentally, Lancashire is named after the hi storic city of Lancaster, which gives its 

 3
name to Lancaster University, where I ha ve been a professor for many years. But 
Lancaster these days is a relatively unim portant city, and the county administration 
has moved to the larger city of Preston further south. On the origin of the name 
Lancaster , see below. 
Among the other county volumes later published by the EPNS are the three 
volumes (vols. XX-XXII) of The Place-Names of Cumberland , by Armstrong et al. 
(1950-52) followed by the two volumes of The Place-Names of Westmorland  (vols. 
XLII, XLIII) by the professor who gave me my ‘job’, A. H. Smith (1964-5). Nobody has yet published the EPNS-aut horized successor to Ekwall’s The Place-Names of 
Lancashire , but happily John Insley (of Heidelbe rg University) is now working on it. 
As the long labours of the EPNS, county by county, have continued, scholarship has 
deepened and county surveys have become  more detailed and rigorous: whereas 
originally one volume was found to be sufficient for one county, nowadays it is 
unlikely that a county will be dealt with in less than six volumes. As a sign of the this 
‘inflation’ of scholarship, A. H. Smith, af ter his two volumes for Westmorland, went 
on to complete eight volumes for just one part of Yorkshire – the West Riding, which 
in its westerly parts might be considered pa rt of our region. It is  not surprising that, 
over 80 years after its founding, in spite of  the patient dedication of place-name 
scholars, the EPNS has not yet completed its plan of publishing studies of every 
county of England. Roughly speaking, it has pub lished one volume of the Survey per 
year, and volumes LXXXII and LXXXIII are now in production. It has also produced 
many additional volumes of a more specialized kind.  Apart from the survey volumes of the EPNS, there are many other published 
sources for studying the place-names of Engl and, varying from articles in journals 
(including the EPNS’s own Journal of the English Place-Name Society ) to 

 4
dictionaries, notably Ekwall’s The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-
Names  (4th edition, 1960) and Victor Watts’s Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-
Names (2004). One volume very useful for my pr esent purpose has recently appeared: 
Diana Whaley’s A Dictionary of Lake District Place-Names (Nottingham: English 
Place-Name Society, 2006).  At this point I should briefly explain the fascination, indeed the ‘uniqueness’ 
of the North-West place-name heritage, as announced in my title. The North West is arguably unique in its rich mixture of place -name origins. In most of England, place-
names are overwhelmingly inherited from OE or from later periods of English. 
Admittedly, some parts of England, (especia lly Cornwall) have a large admixture, 
even a predominance, of Celtic names and na me elements. In yet other parts, roughly 
corresponding to the historical Danelaw in the north and east of England, there is a 
strong heritage of names and name-elements from Old Norse. However, in the North 
West, unlike any other part of England, th ere is a remarkable mixture of three 
historical place-name stocks: Old Englis h, Old Norse, and Old Welsh or more 
precisely Cumbric (the language spoken by th e Celts in this region before the arrival 
of the Anglo-Saxons.)
1 As in other parts of England, th ere is also a small contribution 
of names of Latin/Romance origin: Latin elements such as - caster ‘fort, camp’ (e.g. in  
Lancaster ) inherited from the Roman occupation  of England, and French elements 
such as Egremont  (‘pointed hill’) and  the definite article le in Bolton-le-Sands , arising 
                                                 
1 ‘Unique’ is a hazardous word to use, and I should qualify it here as ‘unique in England ’. The 
threefold mixture of Celtic, Anglian and Norse name el ements is also found across the Scottish border, 
particularly in South-West Scotland. Indeed, duri ng the most formative pe riod for place-names (from 
the 7th to the 11th century) the boundary between England and Scotland was unfixed: most of present-
day Cumbria was still in Scottish hands in the mid-twelfth century.  
 

 5
from the later Norman invasion. However, for my present purpose interest will be 
focused be on the three place-name stocks of OE, ON and Old Celtic.)2 
 There remains a large amount of myst ery and uncertainty about many names 
in the North West. The source of this is inde ed partly the mixing of the three different 
language stocks. But another important factor is the general poverty and 
backwardness of this part of England up to the time of the Industrial Revolution, when 
the cotton and coal industries transformed the southern part of the region.  The Angles 
(as we should call the more northerly Anglo- Saxon settlers) were late in reaching this 
remote and inhospitable region: coming from  the east and south around the turn of the 
seventh century, they settled rather sparse ly. Then, three centuries after the Anglian 
settlement came the Vikings or Norsemen, w ho, in spite of their ferocious reputation, 
in some areas of the North West probabl y settled peaceably, taking over virgin land 
that had previously been uninhabited. Afte r the Norman Conquest, this region partly 
escaped the control of the Normans, a nd William the Conqueror’s Domesday survey, 
in the 1080s, did not penetrate further north than the southern reaches of the present 
Lake District. The earliest records of No rth West place-names rarely predate the 
Domesday book, and often even major settleme nt names appear considerably later. 
Indeed, many quite important names of the La ke District today (e specially those of 
mountains or fells) have no records before the late 18th century. The remote and 
undeveloped nature of the North West in  comparison with southern and eastern 
counties helps to explain the relative povert y of historical records, and consequent 
doubt about origins.  
                                                
 
2 It is also generally held that there are traces of a stratum of name elements older than the Celtic – a 
Common European stratum, which may be the origin of some of the river names of the North West 
region, such as Esk.

3.  Celtic, Anglian and Norse name stocks and their subdivisions  
The most formative period for North West  English place-names, and the period we 
shall be mostly concerned with here, is the period from c.600 to c.900, subsuming the 
Anglian and Scandinavian settlements. Mo st of the major settlement place-names 
must be assumed to date from this period, although the first surviv ing records of these 
names are generally of later date – typically  from the twelfth or thirteenth centuries. 
We should not assume, however, that nami ng practices stood stil l after that date. 
Places (especially minor places) continued to be given new names. It should also be 
remembered that in the northern dialects  of English, words of  Norse origin were 
appropriated, and have continued in us e up to the present day. Examples are beck for a 
brook, fell for a mountain(-side), tarn for a small lake, kirk for a church and dale for a 
valley. Hence the presence of a Norse element in a modern place-name has no implication that that name is as  early as the Norse settlements. 
 On looking more closely at this combina tion of three name stocks, we find that 
there is even more of a mixture than has so far been admitted. In fact, each of the 
three name stocks can be further subdivid ed, so that we need to be aware of six 
different sources of place-name elements:  
Table 1 
name stock subdivisions of name stock t ypical locations in North West England 
Northumbrian dialect North West England generally Old English 
(Anglian) Mercian dialect Some names in Lancashire south of the 
River Ribble 
West Norse (Norwegian) Especially in coastal and upland areas Old Norse 
East Norse (Danish)  In a small area around Manchester and 

 7
possibly elsewhere 
Old Welsh (Cumbric) Scattered around the region, but 
especially found in north Cumbria Old Celtic 
Old Gaelic (from Ireland) Especia lly found in north west Cumbria 
 
The following sections explain and illustrate these sub-divisions.  
3.1 Two Anglian influences  
The largest share of place-names in the Nort h West, as in England in general is from 
OE sources. Thus the Anglian names of Northern England share many linguistic 
elements from OE in general: endings such as –ton (as in Preston ), -ley (as in 
Burnley ), -ham (as in Heysham ), -ford (as in Trafford ) are common in the North West, 
as in the rest of the country. Of greater in terest are elements that are geographically 
limited by their association with particular dialects. The Northumbrian kings were the 
power behind the earlier Anglian incursions, probably via the Lune valley, and so we 
find Northumbrian forms of words such as 
bōþl  ‘building’, in contrast to the Mercian 
dialect from bold  ‘building’, where metathesis has not take place. Interestingly, the 
names Bootle  and Bolton (the latter from earlier Bothlton ) occur in northern part of 
the region, and also in the southern part near Liverpool and Manchester, suggesting 
that the Northumbrian dialect penetrated the whole of the North West. On the other 
hand, the Mercian form bold also occurs in a name such as Parbold , south of the 
River Ribble, evidence of a later period of  Mercian ascendancy. In fact, the Ribble, 
which reaches the sea at Preston in mid-La ncashire, appears to have been a dialect 
boundary of sorts: north of this river, the form – caster  (as in Lancaster , Casterton ) is 

 8
normal for the modern form of the Latin word castra  (‘a fortified camp’), whereas to 
the south of it the form underwent palatalization and diphthongization to ceaster as 
found today, for example, in Manchester  and Ribchester . Thus the area north of the 
Ribble shows pure Northumbrian influences, whereas the area between the Ribble and 
the Mersey shows some mingling of Mercian and Northumbian forms.  
3.2 Two Norse influences  
The Old Norse language of the Viking settle rs, although not so generally prevalent as 
the Anglian branch of OE, has left a strong mark on place-names throughout the 
North West region. To give one example of this: the element – by, of ON origin, vies 
with the OE – ton as the most general term for a farm stead or settlement. In the valley 
of the River Lune, where I live, alongside the OE – ton in Burton, Caton, Middleton , 
etc., occurs the ON – by as in Hornby  and Kirkby (Lonsdale ). The tell-tale ending – by 
occurs widely in the parts of England wher e the Scandinavian settlements occurred in 
the ninth and tenth centuries. The str uggles between the Anglo-Saxons under King 
Alfred the Great and the Vi king invaders reached a comp romise in the Treaty of 
Wedmore (886), where the boundary of the Danelaw, i.e. the area of Danish 
settlement, was determined. The ON name  elements are scattered, though with 
varying density, over the Northern and East ern counties of England, yet it should be 
noted that the settlers in these areas were Danes, speaking a East Norse dialect (OEN). 
In contrast, the settlers in the North West were mainly of Norwegian stock, speaking 
Old West Norse (OWN). These Vikings had found their way by seaborne conquest 
and settlement southwards down the west coast of Scotland, most of them making 
their homes in Ireland and th e Isle of Man before sett ling on the mainland of Great 
Britain.  

 9
In many cases the two dialects bequeat hed the same name-elements (such as 
by, kirk, and gate meaning ‘street’), but in other cases  ‘tell-tale’ name elements point 
towards a West Norse or East Norse origin. Particular elements th at appear to come 
from West Norse include scale  (‘hut’), fell (‘mountain, mountainside’), beck (‘stream, 
brook’), tarn (‘small lake’), gill (‘ravine, mountain stream’), breck  (‘slope’), holm  
(‘island, or eminence amidst low-lying land’), slack  (‘valley’), thwaite (‘clearing’) 
and wray (‘nook, corner’). Here are some exampl es of names with these endings: 
Seascale  (‘hut by the sea’), Scafell (‘ bald-headed mountain’ the name of the highest 
place in England), Tarn Hows , Howgill , Norbreck, Applethwaite, Wray . In England, 
these are more or less peculiar to the North West  region, and attest that the Norse 
settlers in this region mostly haled fro m West Scandinavia. However, they are 
predominantly names of natural features or of  small settlements, which fits in with the 
suggestion that many of the Vikings in this area were content to occupy lands thinly 
settled by the Cumbrians or Angles, and di d not attempt to colonize existing well-
populated areas.   The ‘tell-tale’ elements for East Norse origin are infrequent in the North West, although it is quite likely that Danes di d settle in this area. The ending – thorpe  (for a 
secondary settlement) is common in the Dane law, but the Danelaw scarcely stretched 
to the North West, where – thorpe names are relatively rare ( Milnthorpe  is an 
example). Another sign of Danish settlement is the spelling hulme , corresponding to 
West Norse holm . There is a cluster of hulme  names in the Greater Manchester area 
(Cheadle Hulme , Levenshulme, Davyhulme , etc.), suggesting that there may well have 
been a colony of Danes in this area on the south-east borders of our region. To 
confirm this, certain names such a Flixton  and Urmston  in the same area appear to 

 10
have a Danish personal name as their fi rst element. However, overwhelmingly ON 
place-names in the North West  point to an OWN origin. 
 
3.3  Two Celtic Influences  
I have left Celtic influences to the end of this section, af ter dealing with the Germanic 
influences of OE and ON. The reason for this  apparently out-of-s equence presentation 
is that the Celtic influences come from tw o different periods in the history of North 
West names. The first stratum, of course , antedates the Anglian settlement, and goes 
back well before the arrival of the Roman legions in the first century. The indigenous 
Celts of this region, whom we may call ‘C umbrian Britons’, must have kept their 
language and culture going in th is region for a considerable  time after the Germanic 
settlers had made inroads. The Britons left their mark in a scatter of names across the 
region, among which are some of the most important. Many of the river names (as 
elsewhere in England) represen t this older stratum of name s, either of Celtic or pre-
Celtic origin. Celtic river names like Calder, Cocker, Derwent  and Kent  are paralleled 
by similar names elsewhere in England. The River Lune , which (subject to some 
puzzling sound changes) account s for the first part of Lancaster  and Lonsdale , may 
have a Celtic origin, and one explanation of its meaning is ‘health-giving river’.  
The names Cumbria  and Cumberland derive from a word referring to the 
British Celts and their land, as in the modern Welsh word Cymru  for Wales.  Some of 
the cities of the region also have Celtic elements in their names: Carlisle , on the 
Scottish border, begins with the Celtic element caer ‘fort’ found in such Welsh names 
as Caernarfon and Carmarthen . Another element common among Welsh and Cornish 
names is pen (‘end, top, hill’) survives in the Cumbrian town of Penrith , as well as 
some other names like Pendle (referring to a prominent hill  of East Lancashire) and 

 11
Pen-y-Ghent  (another prominent hill, over the bo rder in West Yorkshire). Other 
elements such as cum (modern Welsh cwm, ‘valley’),  glen (‘valley’) and blen 
(modern Welsh blaen , ‘top’) have survived in Cumbrian places such as Cumwhitton , 
Glenridding , Blencathra . It will be noticed that these elements occur at the beginning 
of a name, whereas the typical position of  the Germanic elements previously 
mentioned is at the end of the name. This  difference reflects a basic difference of 
ordering: in Celtic names the generic term is typically placed first, before the specific, 
whereas in Germanic names this order is reversed. 
It is generally assumed that the Anglo-Saxons, who like English of today 
appear to have been lazy in learning foreign languages,  did not bother to learn the 
language of the Celts. One in teresting piece of evidence for this is that they created 
so-called tautologi cal compounds like Penhill , meaning ‘hill hill’,  not realising that 
the word pen itself meant ‘hill’ in OW. Penhill , in fact, is an earlier form of the name 
Pendle  mentioned above, and to cap it all, the English eventually forgot the origin of 
the word Pendle , and added another word Hill after it. So the name Pendle Hill used 
today means ‘hill hill hill’! 
Evidence of a different sort comes from the name Eccles  (for a town now part 
of Greater Manchester), de rived from the OW noun  egles  (ultimately from Greek 
ekklēsia)  for a church. This seems to indicate  that the Anglians who settled in the 
North West, although probably not yet Christian themselves, were familiar with the church as a British institution. There ar e also three examples of the name Eccleston  
(‘settlement with a British church’) in the region. 
The second stratum of Celtic influen ce came from the Goidelic Celtic (or 
Gaelic) of Ireland, also found in the Isle of Man and the western part of Scotland, 
rather than from the Brythonic Celtic of Gr eat Britain. This infl uence penetrated the 

 12
North West after many Vikings had settled in Ireland in the ninth century. It is clear, 
from linguistic evidence, th at many of the Vikings who came to North West England 
in the early years of the tenth century ha d settled for a considerable time in Ireland, 
and brought with them elements of  the Irish language and culture. 
The evidence of this Irish influence is of five kinds.  
(a) The word cross , the Gaelic word for the symbol of Christianity (ultimately from 
Latin crux , was apparently borrowed by Viki ngs in North West England (and 
eventually supplanted in standard English the OE term for ‘cross’, rōd, ModE rood ). 
The names Crosby  and Cros(s)thwaite , clearly of Viking origin , occur a number of 
times in the North West.  (b) Celtic saints’ names were used in de dicating Cumbrian churches, and these names 
then became names of the settlements that grew up around those churches. Bridekirk  
and Kirkbride  are two villages in north Cumbria,  whose names mean ‘the church of 
St. Bride or St. Bridget’. Mungrisdale  (‘the pig valley associat ed with St. Mungo’) is 
another example. Patterdale (‘valley of Patrick’) may have been named after a man 
whose name was Patrick, rather than from the dedication of its church to the patron 
saint of Ireland. But the Celtic influence is still seen in the Irish personal name. Notice 
that apart from imported Irish/Gaelic saint’s names, these place-names are Norse. 
(c) The ON element 
erg (which in modern names is ofte n spelt in bewildering variety 
(e.g.er, ergh, argh, ark ) is a loanword from Gaelic airigh , meaning ‘shieling, hill-
pasture’. This borrowing into ON is evidenced in the final element of village names 
such as Mansergh, Cleator, Torver, Grimsargh . The village of Arkholme , three miles 

 13
from my home, derives its name  from the dative plural of erg, ergum , and therefore 
means ‘at the shielings’. This name, incide ntally, is an instru ctive example of how 
names become refashioned over the centuri es through a process of re-motivation 
similar to folk-etymology: Arkholme , in spite of appearances , has no connection with 
the ON word holm (‘island’). 
(d) The order of elements in names in the North West sometimes follows the Celtic pattern of generic + specific, rather than the Germanic pattern of specific + generic. 
The two words in (b) above, Bridekirk  and Kirkbride  represent the same name, but the 
order of the first is Germanic and that of the second Celtic. Yet they both have the Norse element kirk. Names like Kirkbride  are termed ‘inversion compounds’ because 
they reverse the normal order in Germanic names. Other inversion compounds are: 
 
 Aspatria :  ‘ash + Patrick’  -  (t he ash tree of Patrick) 
 Rigmaden : ‘ridge + maiden’ – (the ridge of the maiden) 
 Brigsteer : ‘bridge + steer’ -  (the bridge of the steers/oxen) 
 Seatoller : ‘shieling + alder’ -  (the sh ieling with alder trees [?]). 
 (e) Some names refer directly to  the ‘Irish’ living in the area. Ireleth  means ‘the 
slope of the Irish(man)’, and Ireby  means ‘the settlement of the Irish(man)’. It seems 
likely that the ‘Irishmen’ mentioned here  were Vikings who had been living in 
Ireland. Like other names identifying Celts ( Brettargh , meaning ‘the shieling of the 
Briton(s)’, and Walton-le-Dale  meaning ‘the settlement of the Welsh(man) in the 
valley’), these names suggest  that the presence of Ce lts or Irish was somehow 
exceptional enough to be noteworthy, and hence indirectly imply that the Celtic/Irish 
population was relatively small and localized.  

 14
In general, the Irish or Gaelic influence is  found in Cumbria, and even there is largely 
confined to the more north-westerly areas.  I end this section with an important Celtic name which is a curiosity, and does not come from either of the above sources. The name Morecambe is the earliest 
recorded name extant in the region, and yet it refers to a modern town which did not 
develop until the nineteenth century. Mor ecambe, the seaside resort which shares a 
municipality with Lancaster,  derives its name from the work of the Egyptian-Greek 
geographer Ptolemy (c.100-150) who recorded 
Morikāmbe  (OCelt: ‘curve of the 
sea’) as the name of a large bay on th e north-west coast of Britain, now called, 
appropriately, Morecambe Bay . The name was given to the new seaside resort as an 
antiquarian revival. 
 
4. Inflections  
From a linguistic point of view, one of th e intriguing aspects of North West place-
names is the survival, often in a hidden form, of Germanic inflections. Above we noted the survival of the dative plural ergum of the ON noun (borrowed from Gaelic) 
erg, in the disguised form of Arkholme . Another comparable example is the village 
name Thurnham , which appears to end in the familiar place-name element –ham  
(‘homestead’), but in fact deri ves from the ON dative plural 
þyrnum  (‘at the thorn 
bushes’). It was natural that place-names should occur in the dative case (interpreted 
locatively) in an inflectional language like OE or ON – and it happens that both 
languages had the same – um inflection for the dative plural. It is well-known to 
students of English topony my that the OE word burh  ‘fortress, town’ survives in two 

 15
different forms, - borough  and –bury , the latter coming from the dative singular. In the 
historic county of Lancashire, both forms occur in the names Burrow (a hamlet, on the 
site of a Roman camp, two miles from my home) and Bury  (a town in Greater 
Manchester). What is puzzling, however, is why the nominative form survived in one 
case, and the dative form in another. 
 More interesting still is the case of the ON genitive - ar, which survives as –
er(-)  in a considerable number of place-names in the Lake District of Cumbria. 
Examples (with the most likely ON origins on the right) are: 
 Windermere ‘the lake of W īnand’   Winandar-mere  
 Elterwater ‘the lake of the swans’  ON Elptar-vatn , from elptr  ‘swan’. 
 Borrowdale ‘the valley of the fortress river’ ON Borgar-á-dalr  
 Harter Fell ‘the mountain of the hart’  ON Hjartar-fell     
 Witherslack ‘the valley of the wood’ ON  Viðar-slakki 
 
These names are survivals from a time when ON was a living language, and from them we can infer that ON remained in use for some time after the Vikings settled in Cumbria. These names come from the m ountainous Lake District, where we can 
surmise that the Vikings previously unfarm ed land, and did not have to accommodate 
their language to the Celtic  or Anglian communities living around them. OE did not 
have a genitive in –
ar, and therefore comparable fo rms in OE would have an – s 
genitive, as in Kingston  (‘the king’s village’).

5.  Mysterious, misleading, and mixed-up names 
In this section, I will consider some of th e puzzling aspects of place-name research on 
North West England.  First, there are names that have no known origin. Among these, notably, are 
mountain names in the Lake District, like Helvellyn, Glaramara, Wetherlam . Such 
names are well known to the thousands of vi sitors who seek recreational walking or 
climbing on the Cumbrian fells every weekend, but as there are few or no early records, the etymology remains obscure. 
In Arkholme  and Thurnham , I have already given examples of the way in 
which the modern form of names can mislead  as to their origin. This phenomenon is a 
hazard of English place-names in general, but is perhaps more of a problem in the 
case of North Western names than elsewhere. Consider the name Burneside . A 
modern amateur toponymist would guess that it  refers to a place at the ‘side’ of a 
‘burn’ or river, and would find confirmation in the fact that Burneside is a village on 
the bank of the fast-flowing River Kent. Bu t tracing the name back to its earliest 
recorded form Brunolvesheved (c.1180-1292) we reach the conclusion that the 
original name referred to ‘Br ūnwulf’s headland’, that is , a hill belonging to a man 
called Brūnwulf. Such etymological traps for the unwary are an everyday experience 
for place-name students.   The occurrence of ‘mixed names’ – that is, hybrid names containing elements from more than one language – is unsu rprising in a region where three different 
languages have existed side by side. Examples are Kendal, combining the Celtic name 
of the river Kent with the ON 
dalr or OE dæl for ‘valley’: the whole meaning is 
‘valley of the river Kent’. An exam ple of a name mixing OE and ON is Portinscale, 
meaning ‘prostitute’s hut(s)’, from OE portcwēne  (literally ‘lady of the town’) and 

 17
ON skali . Another kind of ‘mixing’ of name st ocks occurs on the phonological, rather 
than the lexical level. The Cumbrian town of Keswick  means ‘cheese farm’, and 
therefore has the same origin as Chiswick  on the Thames near London. But the word 
for ‘cheese’ (OE cēse ) has been ‘Scandinavianized’, / tʃ/ having been replaced by / k/. 
The exact mechanism for this is unclear, but it is common for OE and ON words to 
differ through the correspondence of the stop / k/ in ON for the affricate /t ʃ/ in OE – as 
in kirk for church, or birk for birch  (a variety of tree). This  alternation was somehow 
tranferred to words for which they was no ON cognate form, like cēse  . 
 The compound Barrow-in-Furness , naming a shipbuilding town in south 
Cumbria, illustrates as an extreme case how these various types of mystery and 
mixture come together in one name. Barrow  is generally assumed to come from a 
Celtic word  barr  ‘hill’ and an ON element ey ‘island’. The word Furness  refers to 
the district in which Barrow  is situated, and the leading th eory is that it means ‘the 
headland named after the island of Futh  (ON), ‘cleft or cunt’ – a reference to its

in ON. So there is doubt about the meani ng of the name, and also doubt about the 
languages from which it comes. But it is quite  possible that this one name contains 
Celtic, ON and OE elements.
