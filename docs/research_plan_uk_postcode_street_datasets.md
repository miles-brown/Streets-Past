# Research Plan: UK Postal Address and Street Datasets - SE London Coverage

## Objective
Research comprehensive UK postal address and street datasets that include complete SE London coverage (SE1-SE18 areas), focusing on Royal Mail PAF, third-party databases, OpenStreetMap extracts, and free public APIs.

## Research Tasks

### Phase 1: Royal Mail Postcode Address File (PAF) Research
- [x] 1.1 Research Royal Mail PAF structure, coverage, and data fields
- [x] 1.2 Investigate access methods (direct licensing, third-party resellers)
- [x] 1.3 Document licensing requirements and costs
- [x] 1.4 Assess data quality and SE London coverage specifics

### Phase 2: Third-Party UK Address Databases
- [x] 2.1 Research Postcodes.io API (postcodes.io) - structure, coverage, limitations
- [x] 2.2 Investigate get-address.io API - features, pricing, SE coverage
- [x] 2.3 Explore other major third-party services (Google Places API, AddressIQ, etc.)
- [x] 2.4 Compare pricing models and data completeness

### Phase 3: OpenStreetMap London Extracts
- [x] 3.1 Research OSM data extraction methods for London
- [x] 3.2 Identify official OSM London extracts and services
- [x] 3.3 Investigate Overpass API for SE London postal areas
- [x] 3.4 Assess data quality and completeness for SE1-SE18

### Phase 4: Free Public APIs and Datasets
- [x] 4.1 Research government open data sources (ONS, Ordnance Survey)
- [x] 4.2 Investigate postcode-focused APIs (postcodes.io, postcodevalidator)
- [x] 4.3 Look for street-level APIs with postcode coverage
- [x] 4.4 Assess completeness for SE London areas

### Phase 5: Data Quality Assessment
- [x] 5.1 Evaluate data completeness for SE1-SE18 areas across sources
- [x] 5.2 Compare address accuracy and street coverage
- [x] 5.3 Document update frequencies and data freshness
- [x] 5.4 Identify any gaps or limitations

### Phase 6: Documentation and Report Generation
- [x] 6.1 Compile all findings into comprehensive report
- [x] 6.2 Include API documentation with example endpoints
- [x] 6.3 List all dataset URLs and access methods
- [x] 6.4 Provide recommendations for SE London specific use cases
